We report on the design and construction of a goggle-type eye tracker using a low-cost and high-speed lensless camera for monitoring eye movements in neurodegenerative diseases. A Rolling Shutter image sensor combined with lensless computational imaging allows for the reconstruction of a time sequence of images from a single snapshot, effectively improving the framerate of the camera. We constructed and demonstrated the prototype device using a commercial-grade CMOS image sensor and achieved the improvement of framerate from 15 to 480Hz, with the tracking results for 28 clinical measured data. Our device can potentially measure microsaccadic eye movements in a wearable camera format, allowing routine monitoring of abnormal eye movements for the early diagnosis and tracking of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.
