Portable Microscope Using Smartphone

The reduction of the size and cost of microscopes creates new possibilities for disease screening and health care in resource-limited settings. Smartphones and mobile devices can be useful for the construction of compact and portable imaging devices, by replacing expensive and bulky optical instruments with state-of-the-art cameras, high-performance processors, and network connectivity in a compact footprint. The rapid dissemination of smartphones and their user-friendly interfaces can allow for microscopic imaging and evaluation of biological specimens to be accessible to the general public as well as trained health care professionals. As the technologies for image sensors, miniaturized optics, and mobile processors continue to develop, these smartphone-enabled devices are expected to change how medical tests and evaluations are conducted in the field, as well as in the lab.
