I’m currently a PhD student in Electrical Engineering at Yonsei University advised by Prof. Seung Ah Lee. Additionally, I had the opportunity to work in the Biomedical Engineering department at Duke University with Prof. Roarke Horstmeyer’s lab supported by the Graduate Biomedical Research Fellowship funded by the Korean government. I enjoy chats and collaborative works with individuals who share a passion for their work :)

My research is focused on computational optics and imaging, functional imaging system design, and machine-learning for bio-medical imaging. I have particular experience with Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy (FPM), phase mask design for lensless imaging, and speckle imaging using speckle statistics. I am also open to exploring computational deep learning techniques aiming for joint optimization of hardware and software.
