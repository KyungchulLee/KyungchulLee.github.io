I’m currently a PhD student in Electrical Engineering at Yonsei University advised by [Prof. Seung Ah Lee](https://sites.google.com/oisl.me/oisl/). During my PhD studies, I had the opportunity to work with [Prof. Roarke Horstmeyer’s lab](http://horstmeyer.pratt.duke.edu/) in the Biomedical Engineering department at Duke University. I am a recipient of the Silver Prize at the 28th [Samsung Humantech Paper Awards](https://humantech.samsung.com/saitext/index.jsp) and [NRF](https://www.nrf.re.kr/index) Graduate Research Fellowships.

My research primarily focuses on computational optics and imaging, particularly the co-design of optical hardware and image processing software for real-world applications. I have extensive experience with mask based lensless imaging, Fourier ptychography, and in-vivo imaging using speckle dynamics. I enjoy chats and collaborative works with individuals who share a passion for their work :)
