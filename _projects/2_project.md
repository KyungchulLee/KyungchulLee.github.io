Lensless cameras have emerged as a powerful compact imaging system with diverse computational imaging capabilities. Here, we developed a method for the high-throughput fabrication of lensless cameras designed with arbitrary point spread functions and showed real-world imaging applications including deep-learning based image reconstruction and optical template matching.
