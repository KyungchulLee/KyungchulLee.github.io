Iâ€™m currently a Ph.D. student in Electrical Engineering at Yonsei University advised by [Prof. Seung Ah Lee](https://sites.google.com/oisl.me/oisl/) with my research centered on computational optics and imaging. During my Ph.D. studies, I had the opportunity to be mentored by [Prof. Roarke Horstmeyer](http://horstmeyer.pratt.duke.edu/) in the Biomedical Engineering department at Duke University. I've been honored to receive the Silver Prize at the [28th Samsung Humantech Paper Awards](https://humantech.samsung.com/saitext/index.jsp) and Graduate Research Fellowships from the [NRF](https://www.nrf.re.kr/eng/index) and [MOHW](https://www.mohw.go.kr/eng/index.jsp).

My research interests broadly encompass computational optics and imaging, with a particular focus on co-designing optical hardware and image processing software aiming to create advanced imaging systems for real-world applications. I have extensive experience in mask-based lensless imaging, Fourier ptychography, and in-vivo imaging using speckle dynamics. I enjoy chats and collaborative works with individuals who share a passion for their work :)
